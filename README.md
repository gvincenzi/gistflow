# GistFlow, an open source content ingestion engine

## Overview

GistFlow is an open source content ingestion engine : you can define and schedule your contents publication flows from different sources and to different destinations.

## How it works
GISTFlow system is based on three components:
- Sensors
- Actuators
- Ingesters 

### Sensor
A sensor is a an object that observes a source continuously and detects all changes and updates : it will be an RSS reader, an Active Directory, a chatbot.

### Actuator
An actuator is a bridge object that realize a cross relation between multiple sensors and ingesters.
 When a linked sensor detects a change, an actuator receives the list of new contents, applies an eventual data pretreatment, and launches a list of ingesters to publish the list of contents to different destinations.

### Ingester
An ingester is a software component with the capability of publish a content to a specific platform via a specific API.
