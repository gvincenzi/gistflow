# GistFlow, an open source content ingestion engine

## Overview

GistFlow is an open-source content ingestion engine that allows you to define and schedule content publication flows from various sources to different destinations.

### Components
GistFlow is built on three main components:

1. **Sensors**: These observe a source continuously and detect changes or updates. Examples include RSS readers, Active Directory, or chatbots.

2. **Actuators**: These act as bridges between sensors and ingesters. When a linked sensor detects a change, the actuator receives the new content, applies any necessary pre-treatment, and triggers ingesters to publish the content.

3. **Ingesters**: These are responsible for publishing content to specific platforms via APIs.

## Features
